# Terraform Cloud Azure Initial Demo

An initial demo of a simple Terraform root module to test VCS integration with
Terraform Cloud. This was initially based on the Terraform Getting Started
Example Code, however that was using AWS. This repo modifies that simple example
to use Azure in a similarly simple manner.

## What will this do?

This is a Terraform configuration that will create a VM in your Azure
subscription.

When you set up a Workspace on Terraform Cloud, you can link to this repository.
Terraform Cloud can then run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` automatically
when changes are pushed. For more information on how Terraform Cloud interacts
with Version Control Systems, see
[our VCS documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/run/ui.html).

## What are the prerequisites?

You must have an Azure subscription, create a Service Principal for use by
Terraform, and then provide the details of this Azure credential to Terraform
Cloud via a Variable Set. Terraform Cloud encrypts and stores variables using
[Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/). For more information on how to store
variables in Terraform Cloud, see
[our variable documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/workspaces/variables.html).

The values for `ARM_TENANT_ID`, `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `ARM_CLIENT_ID` and
`ARM_CLIENT_SECRET` should be saved as environment variables on your workspace.

## How to create a Service Principal for use in Terraform Cloud

1. Create Service Principal

    ```bash
    az login

    az account list

    az account set --subscription ${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}

    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name Terraform \
                             --role Contributor \
                             --scopes /subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}
    ```

2. Test Service Principal
    * Extract the TENANT_ID from the `az account list` output
    * Obtain the SUBSCRIPTION_ID from the Azure Portal
    * Extract the CLIENT_ID from the `appId` field of the
      `az ad sp create-for-rbac` output
    * Extract the CLIENT_SECRET from the `password` field of the
      `az ad sp create-for-rbac` output

    ```bash
    az login --service-principal \
             --tenant ${TENANT_ID} \
             --user ${CLIENT_ID} \
             --password ${CLIENT_SECRET}

    az vm list-sizes --location westus -o table

    az logout
    ```
